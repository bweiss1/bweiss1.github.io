# Project 1 486:

## Topic: 
Average distance from a residential, Baltimore City household, to a park

## Data: 
Real_Property: http://gis-baltimore.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/real-property

Parks: https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Culture-Arts/Parks/3r8a-uawz


## Transformations/Subsets:
Subsetting Real_Property: USEGROUP to R for Residential


## Analysis: 
Nearest neighbor analysis and a series of buffer analyses 

## Outputs:
I will be creating a couple outputs. First, I will create an output of nearest neighbor analysis from residential propeties to parks to help determine my buffer distances. Second, I will be creating buffers of various distances (at least 3) around my park area points. Third, I will be creating outputs of each residential household that is at a speciic distance from a park and symbolizing based on distance.
